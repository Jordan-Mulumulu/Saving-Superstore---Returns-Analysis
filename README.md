📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes product returns at the fictional "Superstore" to identify the main drivers behind return rates and provide actionable insights to reduce losses. The analysis leverages sales, returns, geographic, and time-based data to uncover trends, correlations, and high-risk areas.

🎯 Objectives

Measure returns using Return Rate, Total Number of Returns, and Total Cost of Returns.

Identify root causes of returns by analyzing products, customers, regions, and time periods.

Develop a dashboard for ongoing monitoring and decision-making.
